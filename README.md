Java Entertainment Equipment Booking System
Advanced Programming group project 

This project involves creating an Event Scheduling System for Java Entertainment, a
company that rents equipment for events. The goal is to help them manage their inventory,
schedule equipment without double-booking, handle billing, and optionally generate reports on
bookings and revenue. The system will be built as a Java-based Client/Server application with a
user-friendly interface, allowing clients to interact with a centralized database. Extra features
include support for multiple users through a threaded server and the ability to export reports to
PDF. The project should focus on clean database design, intuitive functionality, and scalability to
meet the companyâ€™s needs during the busy Spring Break season.

The PDF included in the repo contains the Project Report -- a summarized project description, member contributions, entity-relationship diagram and user interface diagram; Developers' Notes with a development plan which includes the project setup and core deign, database and core functionality implementation, user interface + advanced features, threading, reports and finalizing features, and final testing and documentation.

A basic user manual is also provided. 

The project isn't hosted via a third party; the source code must be downloaded, compiled and ran locally.
